                        waking up every morning, knowing that i am a problem solver and not just a programmer gives me
                        a warmth in my heart, knowing that a programmer is a problem solver.

                        Today, almost everything can be found on the internet. Answers to question whether they make
                        sense
                        or not, online shop, online course and tutorials, online entertainment such as movies and games,
                        and even online dating is on the internet. As this generation’s technology becomes more and more
                        popular and in-demand globally, so is the need for people with programming skills.

                        And all these are not just for today, but also tomorrow. A computer scientist and a professor,
                        Alan
                        Kay once said,
                        “the best way to predict the future is to invent it.”
